# Books_A_Hundreds

This is a simple example of a RESTful API server using the Golang programming language.
The application will track books from my personal library, and allow me to view, update, and delete books from my collection.
I use the gorilla/mux package for HTTP request routing, and provide JSON formatted data in response to those requests.
The goal is to build a flexible API that responds to HTTP GET, PUT, CREATE, and POST requests.
